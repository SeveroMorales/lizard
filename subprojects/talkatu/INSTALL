# Building

Talkatu uses [meson](https://mesonbuild.com) as it's build system.

Meson requires you to build in a directory other than the source directory.

To compile you can use the following commands:

```
meson build
cd build
```

To test Talkatu without installing, you can run the following command from the
build directory.

```
meson devenv talkatu-demo
```

To install you can use `ninja install` from the build directory.
